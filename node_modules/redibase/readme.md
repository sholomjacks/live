## Redibase

This package is the redis based alternative to google's firebase.
The goal is to harness the speed of vanilla redis while adding much loved firebase features.
With this package you can subscribe to data changes, store deeply nested data without stringifying and you can own your stack.


## Installation
```
npm i redibase  // Or yarn add redibase
```

## Initialise a redis connection
Parameters are passed directly to the redis constructor.
```js
import { connect } from 'redibase'
const redibase = connect('redis://....')
export redibase
```
## Modify data
Paths can be given as arrays or strings with dots
```js
redibase.set('people', [{name: 'john', age: 29}, {name: 'sandy', age: 26}])) 
redibase.set(['people', 0, 'age'], 30)
redibase.set('people.0.age', 31)
```
You can hold references to portions of the json
```js
const set_sandys_age = redibase.set('people.1.age')
set_sandys_age(27) 
set_sandys_age(28) 
```
## Retrieve data
```js
redibase.get('people.0')
redibase.get(['people', 0])
```
## Delete data
```js
redibase.delete('people')
redibase.get('people') // null
```

## Subscribe to data
```js
const subscription_id = redibase.on(['people', 0, 'name'], (new_val, old_val) => console.log(new_val, old_val))
redibase.off(subscription_id)
```

## Close redis connection
```js
redibase.quit()
```

## Unsupported features
You can always access the redis directly
```js
redibase.client.mget(my_args)
```
## Limitations 
The maximum number of nesting layers is limited by the javascript recursion depth, which is around 10000. By comparison, firebase allows 32 layers of nesting.

The maintainers are always happy to add custom features if you ask with examples.
